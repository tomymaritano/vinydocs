# 📦 Viny Installation

Welcome to Viny! This DMG contains everything you need to install the app.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. **Double-click** the **Install Script** in this DMG
2. **Follow the prompts** - it will handle everything automatically
3. **Launch Viny** from your Applications folder

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Drag Viny.app** to the Applications folder
2. **Open Terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/Viny.app

## ⚠️ Why the extra step?

macOS blocks apps that aren't signed by Apple Developer Program certificates. We're working on getting proper certificates for future releases.
