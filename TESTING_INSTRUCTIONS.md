# Testing Instructions for Notebook Persistence Issue

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Modal Theme**: Updated CreateNotebookModal to use proper theme classes
✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging
✅ **Storage Management**: Improved localStorage handling

## Problem Description

User reports that new notebooks are not being saved when refreshing the app. They appear to be created successfully in the modal but disappear when the app is refreshed.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Open the Application

- Navigate to http://localhost:5174/
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Go to the Console tab

### 2. Test Basic Persistence

In the browser console, run:

```javascript
debugNotebooks()
```

This will show current notebooks in localStorage.

### 3. Test Manual Creation

In the browser console, run:

```javascript
testNotebookCreation()
```

This will create a test notebook and verify it's saved.

### 4. Test UI Creation

1. Click the "+" button next to "Notebooks" in the sidebar
2. Enter a unique name (e.g., "Test Category 123")
3. Select a color
4. Click "Create Category"
5. Watch the console for logs

### 5. Check for Validation Issues

The console will show:

- `Creating notebook:` - Initial creation attempt
- `Current notebooks before validation:` - Existing notebook names
- `Name validation failed:` - If name validation fails
- `Nesting validation failed:` - If parent validation fails
- `New notebook created:` - If validation passes
- `useEffect: Saving notebooks to localStorage:` - When saving to storage

### 6. Verify Persistence

1. After creating a notebook, refresh the page
2. Check if the notebook still appears in the sidebar
3. Run `debugNotebooks()` again to see if it's in localStorage

## Expected Behavior

- Notebooks should be saved to localStorage immediately after creation
- Notebooks should persist after page refresh
- Console should show successful creation and saving

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Duplicate Names**: User might be trying to create a notebook with an existing name
2. **Validation Errors**: Check console for validation failure messages
3. **localStorage Issues**: Check if localStorage is working properly
4. **React State Issues**: Check if state updates are being reflected

## Debug Functions Available

### Basic Debug

- `debugNotebooks()` - Show current notebooks in localStorage
- `testNotebookCreation()` - Create a test notebook manually

### Storage Testing

- `inspectNotebookStorage()` - Detailed inspection of localStorage
- `clearNotebookStorage()` - Clear all notebook data
- `testNotebookPersistence()` - Complete persistence test (step 1)
- `testNotebookPersistence2()` - Complete persistence test (step 2)

### Advanced Testing

Run these in order to test persistence:

1. `clearNotebookStorage()` - Clear data
2. Reload page
3. `testNotebookPersistence2()` - Add test data
4. Reload page
5. `inspectNotebookStorage()` - Check if data persisted
